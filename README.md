A row counter for knitting

I don't knit but my girlfriend does. She was planning to buy a knitting row counter which costs around $8 and all it does it remember the row that you are at. I told her I can create one for her for half the price. jk. I create it for free since it is super simple. The app just require an input field, a submit button, increment and decrement buttons. It is extremely simple to use, the user type in the number of row that they are at. Then after finishing 1 row, the user click the increment button and it will output the row that the user are at. I added a few more feature like decrement and reset when the user finish the number of row that they desired.
